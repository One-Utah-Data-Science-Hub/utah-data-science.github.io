## Existing Strengths
### The University of Utah is a regional leader in education
The University of Utah launched the undergraduate Data Science program in 2019. As of Fall 2022, the program has 76 students and has served as a model for more recently launched programs in the region.  

### Our faculty are doing innovative data science
* [*How People Actually Lie With Charts*](https://vdl.sci.utah.edu/blog/2023/04/17/misleading/), Alex Lex and Marina Kogan
* [*Mapper Interactive: A Scalable, Extendable, and Interactive Toolbox for the Visual Exploration of High-Dimensional Data*](https://users.cs.utah.edu/~zhouyj/publications/2conferences/Mapper_Interactive/MapperInteractive_YoujiaZhou_2021.pdf), Youjia Zhou, Nithin Chalapathi, Archit Rathore, Yaodong Zhao,  Bei Wang
  + [*Protein-metabolite interactomics of carbohydrate metabolism reveal regulation of lactate dehydrogenase*](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm3452), Science
  + [*Metaboverse enables automated discovery and visualization of diverse metabolic regulatory patterns*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-023-01117-9), Nature Cell Bio
* [*Scientific Machine Learning: using machine learning to automatically from data uncover models of physical systems*](), Shandian Zhe et al.

### We are a leader in population data curation and host unique data sets
See our growing list of these [resources](https://utah-data-science-hub.github.io/data.html)!

### Utah hosts a fast growing digital technology and data science economy
* Genomic data science for diagnostics and gene discovery, supported by the UCGD and CGM on the Health Sciences campus and in the Department of Biology.
* BioHive
* SiliconSlopes
* The Point

### The University of Utah is known for multidisciplinary centers of innovation

### The University of Utah has a rich history of translational impact

### We are aimed to accel in the future
* We are fostering a data science community through activities such as [Annual Data Science Day](https://datascience.utah.edu/events/2023/data-science-day), the [UCDS Seminar Series](https://datascience.utah.edu/seminar.html), the DATASET Discovery Workshops, the [DELPHI Data Science Education Workshops](https://utah-data-science-hub.github.io/education_courses.html), and many more.
* We are integrated with local technology companies and are supporting an upcoming event with BioHive. 



## Future Aspirations
### Advance infrastructure for innovation
* Data: The actual data has been collected
* Storage and Computing: To do things with the data
* Interfaces: To enable research on the data (largely missing)
* Responsible: Guidance for how to use infrastructure and models responsibly

### Be the next national hub for data science and attract global talent
### Supply local talent and transfer innovation to local industry
### Data science education is pervasive and available to everyone one campus
### Lead in development of data science as a new paradigm for science
### Create a frictionless data science community 
* We are aware of local expertise, ongoing projects, and are initializing
* We are proud to host an environment of cross-collaboration, where research is truly larger than the sum of the parts
  + We are in the process of developing a network of collaborations to showcase this environment
  
### Serve our community based on identified needs
From our initial survey our community of data scientists is looking for collaboration, funding opportunities, education, and connection to students and industry.
